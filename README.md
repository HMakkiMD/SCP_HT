# SCP_HT
High-throughput simulation of 105 semiconducting polymers (SCP)
This repository contents:
1. Input files (including the structure and force field) for 105 SCP studied in (link)
2. Codes to analyse structural features of SCP models (example for 1 SCP is provided)
3. Density of States (DOS) and Locatisation Length (LL) as a function of energy for 105 SCPs
4. Codes to analyse electronic properties from DOS and LL
